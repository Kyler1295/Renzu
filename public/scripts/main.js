My love for Editing grew and eventually I wanted nothing more than to become a professional editor. I\'ve Edited for large creators and organizations such as Redmercy and Immortals, now I own Renzu. I started Renzu because I, like many others noticed a track record of Editors being poorly treated and poorly compensated. Editors that wanted nothing more than to have it be their full time job, but weren\'t being paid fairly, and thus couldn\'t sustain themselves; I set out to put a stop to this by creating Renzu as a Team and Community of Media professionals that can come together and support each other. My main goal is to have everyone around me thrive, both employees, and clients. At Renzu, no one is left behind.',
